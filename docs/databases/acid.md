# Acid

## Atomic

- Statements in a transactions are executed all or none


## Consistent

- Each transactions results in a consistent state that satasfies referential, uniqueness, nullness constraints

also see: [CAP Theorem](cap.md)

## Isolation

- Ensures concurrent execution of transactions produces state equivalent that produced by sequential execution

## Durable

- Committed transactions are not lost if server crashes
